# Tarot reading notion widget
Simple randomised tarot card picker widget for the workspace application [Notion](https://www.notion.com/). By clicking a button you draw one of the 78 cards in [Riderâ€“Waite's tarot deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider%E2%80%93Waite_Tarot). It is designed for Notion's *dark mode* `#191919`, however you can adjust the colors accordingly if you replicate the repository and add your personal changes.

- **How to use:** Copy this link: **_https://rayray-0.github.io/Daily-tarot-notion-widget/_** and embed in Notion.

- **Possible widget improvements if I ever feel like it:**
- [ ] add different types of decks
